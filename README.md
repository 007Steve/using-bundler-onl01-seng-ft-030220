# Using Bundler

## Deliverables

Fork this repository. Deliver your solution in the master branch.

## Instructions

Follow along with the rspec test. Make sure to read the comments above each
test. There are a lot of regular expressions in the tests, so if
something seems like it should be working but it's not, make sure that
the regex is being picky (tell someone and we will fix the regex if it's
not accomodating for a reasonable solution).
